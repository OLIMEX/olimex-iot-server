	<p>
		Log in into <b>OlimexIoT Server</b>. If you have alredy configured some nodes
		you should see something like this:

	<p>Before moving forward you may want to read about <a href="node-manage.html">Node management</a>.</p>
	
	<p>
		In the screenshot above we have two nodes <span class="green">ESP_EVB</span> and 
		<span class="green">ESP_PLUG</span> and each node has several devices.
		<span class="red nowrap">MOD-EMTR</span> device is highlighted in red because 
		at this moment an event occurs.
	</p>
	
	<p>You can see each node's <b>Name</b>, <b>IP Address</b> and <b>Token</b>.</p>
	
	<blockquote class="info">
		If the node is behind NAT or proxy you will see its IP address.<br/>
		More information for node's IP address is available at its menu <img src="images/menu.png" />
		<a href="node-manage.html#info">Station info</a>
	</blockquote>

	<p>By clicking on device name we can expand the device's additional information.</p>
	<img src="images/monitor-02.jpg" />
	
	<p>If the node is not connected it will be grayed. Note that we can still expand devices.</p>
	<img src="images/monitor-03.jpg" class="center" />
	
	<p>If the connection with the node is lost you may see error code and message.</p>
	<img src="images/monitor-04.jpg" class="center" />
	
	<p>
		If there is too much information to be shown on main screen the maximize icon 
		<img src="images/maximize.png" /> will be displayed. By clicking on the icon
		you will see all information available for this device. Some additional devices 
		can be shown if they are related to maximized device. 
	</p>
	<blockquote class="hint">
		For example, if you maximize <span class="green">ESP_PLUG</span>'s <b>MOD-EMTR</b> device 
		<b>RELAY</b> device will be shown as well so you can easily switch it on and off
		and see how power consumption is changed.
