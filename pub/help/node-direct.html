	<h1>Direct Node Connection</h1>
	
	<p>Back to <a href="index.html">OlimexIoT Help</a></p>
	
	<p>
		Direct node connection gives you full control over IoT Node. You can change all settings, credentials
		and upload new versions of the firmware. Direct node connection is not always possible.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		For example if you use our free OlimexIoT Service and you are outside your home network there 
		is no way to direct connect to your nodes.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Direct node connection is implemented as HTML5 application located at 
		<a href="http://iot.olimex.com/direct/">http://iot.olimex.com/direct/</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To direct connect to a node you can use node's Access point	or Station IP address.
		Default address is set to 192.168.4.1 which is AP default address.

	<h2>Connect via AP</h2>
	<p>To connect using node's AP you have to be in the range of AP and</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Navigate to <a href="http://iot.olimex.com/direct/">http://iot.olimex.com/direct/</a>
			to open the application.
		</li>
		<blockquote class="hint">
			If you are using a mobile device you can use <span class="green">Add to Home screen</span> in order to have the HTML5 
			application available even when you are not online.
		</blockquote>
		<br/>
		<li>
			Connect your WiFi to node's AP. <br/>
			Default SSID is one of
			<ul>
				<li>ESP_OLIMEX_XXXXXX</li>
				<li>ESP_PLUG_XXXXXX</li>
				<li>ESP_SWITCH1_XXXXXX</li>
				<li>ESP_SWITCH2_XXXXXX</li>
				<li>ESP_DIMMER_XXXXXX</li>
			</ul>
			Default PSK <b>olimex-ap</b>
		</li>
		<li>
			Enter AP's IP address <br/>
			default is <b>192.168.4.1</b>
		</li>
		<li>
			Enter <span class="green">User</span><br/>
			default <b>olimex</b></li>
		<li>
			Enter <span class="green">Password</span><br/>
			default <b>olimex</b></li>
		<li>
			Press <span class="green">Connect</span> button
		</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		After finishing your work with the node you may want to disconnect your device from node's AP and 
		connect it back to your WiFi network.
	</blockquote>
	
	<h2>Connect via Station IP</h2>
	<p>
		Login to IoT Server. There are two ways to connect to your node using different IP addresses. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>From main screen</li>
		<li>From node's Station Info</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		From main screen click on the name of the node. This is usable when your device the IoT Server 
		and the node are in same network.
	</p>
	<blockquote class="info">
		Note that in this case if there is NAT firewall or proxy server between the node and the 
		IoT Server its address will be used and this will probably block the connection to the node.
	</blockquote>
	<img src="images/direct-02.jpg" />
	
	<p>
		Click on IP address from node's Station Info. This is usable when your device and the node 
		are in same network.
	</p>
	<blockquote class="info">
		Note that this case internal network address of the node will be used and this will work only
		if you are in the same network with the node.
	</blockquote>
	<img src="images/direct-03.jpg" />
	
	<p>
		If connection is successful system information about the node will be displayed. From this
		screen you can restart the node or reset all settings to factory defaults.
	</p>

	<h2>General Config</h2>
	<p>
		Here you can change the <span class="green">User</span> and the <span class="green">Password</span> 
		used when connecting to the node. You can set <span class="green">Mode</span> in which node operates: 
		Access Point, Station or both. If <span class="green">Authentication</span> check box is unchecked 
		you can connect without user and password. If <span class="green">SSL</span> check box is checked 
		only SSL connections will be accepted.
	</p>
	<img src="images/direct-05.jpg" />
	
	<h2>Configure Access Point</h2>
	<p>Here you can configure node's Access Point.</p>
	<img src="images/direct-06.jpg" />
	
	<h2>Configure Station</h2>
	<p>
		Here you can configure node's Station i.e. credentials for your existing WiFi network 
		to which node will connect. If you are using DHCP you and the node is connected you 
		can see node's IP address.
	</p>

	<h2>Configure IoT</h2>
	<p>Here you can configure connection to IoT Server</p>
	<img src="images/direct-08.jpg" />
	
	<h2>Configure SSL</h2>
	<p>Here you can upload your private key and certificate used for direct SSL connections.</p>
